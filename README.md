# C++ UDG Wireless Network - Data Structures Semester Project

## Overview
The **Cpp-UDG_Wireless_Network** project implements a wireless network simulation using **C++**. It leverages an **Unweighted Directed Graph (UDG)** model to represent the network topology, where nodes represent wireless devices and directed edges represent communication links between them. The simulation models wireless communication, network traffic, and the impact of network topology on performance.

## Features
- **UDG Representation**: Wireless network topology represented using an unweighted directed graph.
- **Wireless Communication Simulation**: Simulates the behavior of communication between wireless nodes in the network.
- **Dynamic Node Connections**: Nodes dynamically connect and disconnect based on signal strength, range, and other factors.
- **Routing Algorithms**: Implements basic routing protocols (e.g., Dijkstraâ€™s, AODV) to simulate packet routing within the network.
- **Network Performance Metrics**: Tracks and outputs key network metrics like packet loss, throughput, and delay.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: The primary programming language used for simulating network behavior and implementing algorithms.
- **Standard Libraries**: Utilizes C++ standard libraries for data structures, algorithms, and input/output operations.
- **Graph Data Structures**: Unweighted directed graph for representing the network topology.
